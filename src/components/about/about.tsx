          <p>
            Hello! My name is <span className="purple-text">Nevil Savaliya</span>, I'm a passionate developer with a love for coding and technology. Most recently, I am working as a <span className="purple-text">Software Developer at CSE </span>
            (Communications Security Establishment) and previously a Software Developer at Bell.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently <span className="purple-text"> studying at Pes University. </span>
            in my <span className="purple-text">First year</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests change greatly depending on my environment, but at the moment, I am most interested by  
            <span className="purple-text"> AI/ML, IOT Tech, and App Development.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            My skillset is quite wide-ranged, I don't focus all too heavy on the frameworks/languages, I like to choose
            the best tools to get the best product as fast as possible. I'm a quick learner, especially in fast-paced environments
            where I'm able to hone skills on the fly to improve and deliver on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            My love for tech goes beyond the classroom. Iâ€™m always eager to dive into the world of hackathons and tech conferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of tech, you'll typically find me playing hockey, , listening/discovering some live music.
          </p>
